Work on this is still progressing, but very slowly - and there is still a lot to be done on the UI/UX to unlock it's full power.

However recently we updated the app to Symfony 2.8. We added a vagrant box so people who want to develop the app or run it's tests can do so very easily. And we updated the instructions in the UI/UX to use ACRA's new ConfigurationBuilder.
